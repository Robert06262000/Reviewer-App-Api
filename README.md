# Reviewer-App-Api
A reviewer app that uses ASP.Net and a sql server. This core web api was my first big step into web development and really taught me the importance of connecting and editing data, as well as teaching me how to use a sql server alongside Visual Studio Code. It categorizes Pokemon by their types, names, and reviews/reviewers, and even categorizes their reviewers.
